Medicine Recommendation System Using Text-Based Similarity Model
The Medicine Recommendation System is an intelligent application of machine learning aimed at assisting healthcare professionals in prescribing the most suitable medications based on a patient’s symptoms, medical history, and known allergies. This system is designed to enhance clinical decision-making, reduce the likelihood of adverse drug reactions, and improve patient outcomes through personalized recommendations.
At the core of this system is a Text-Based Similarity Model, which leverages natural language processing (NLP) techniques to analyze and match patient input with relevant medication data. The project begins with extensive data collection from electronic health records, clinical trials, and verified medical literature, compiling information on diseases, symptoms, drugs, and contraindications.
The collected data undergoes thorough pre-processing, including cleaning, normalization, and the removal of duplicates and inconsistencies. To prepare the textual data for machine learning, vectorization techniques—such as TF-IDF (Term Frequency–Inverse Document Frequency) or word embeddings—are used to convert textual symptom descriptions and medication information into numerical representations that the model can understand and process.
In the feature extraction stage, critical attributes such as symptoms, allergies, patient demographics, and prior conditions are identified to provide context for accurate recommendations. The Text-Based Similarity Model then compares the vectorized input of a patient’s symptoms with the existing medical dataset to identify the most closely associated conditions and recommend appropriate medications.
The model is trained and validated using performance metrics such as cosine similarity scores, accuracy, and relevance of recommendation. Its ability to understand and evaluate semantic relationships in text allows it to generate highly relevant and personalized outputs.
This system demonstrates the practical application of NLP and machine learning in healthcare, offering a scalable solution that can be integrated into electronic medical platforms to support doctors and clinical staff in delivering safe, efficient, and patient-centered care.
